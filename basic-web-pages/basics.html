      <h1>Interneting is Easy and Ofcource Easy!</h1>
      <p>First we need to learn some basic html.</p>

      <h2>Headings</h2>
      <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

      <h2>Lists</h2>

      <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each iteme in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything.</li>
        <li>But, the list item elemnts are the same</li>
        <li>Also note that the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
      <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or a phrase.</p>
      <p>Other time you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or a phrase</p>
      <p><em><strong>And Sometimes you need to shout</strong></em></p>

      <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
      <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>

      <p>Regards,<br>
